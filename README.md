# _rogue-like-TOGAC
A post apocalyptic western fallout-inspired rogue-like based in a world I created for my DND campaigns :D

This is my dream project and I have been working on it on and off for some time now. The development is mostly frozen until the completion of my infinite runner game, but I do come back to it every now and then.

### Please keep in mind that a lot of things in this project are due to be changed 

In this repository You can find the scripts I am making for this particular project, as well as some of the artwork and general updates.
